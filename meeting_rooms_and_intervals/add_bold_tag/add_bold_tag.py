'''
You are given a string s and an array of strings words.  You should add a closed pair of bold tag <b> and </b> to wrap the substrings in s that exist in words.
- if 2 such substrings overlap, you should wrap them together with only one pair of closed bold-tag.
- if 2 substrings wrapped by bold tags are consecutive, you should combine them.
